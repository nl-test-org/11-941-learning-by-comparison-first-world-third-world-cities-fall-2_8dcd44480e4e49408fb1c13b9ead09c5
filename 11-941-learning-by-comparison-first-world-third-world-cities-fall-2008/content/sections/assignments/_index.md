The topic of the semester-long research paper will be the crafting of a sophisticated methodology—based on relevant theory, appropriate units of analysis, sensitivity to context, and significant purpose—comparing a First World city from western Europe, North America, the Australian subcontinent, or Japan, with a Third World city of Africa, Asia, or Latin America. The paper will focus on an urban-scale issue that is relevant to both cities, such as poverty alleviation, housing provision, metropolitan governance, community development, multiculturalism, catalytic projects, urban form, or local control in the face of economic globalization.

The research paper will be prepared and developed during the semester in four phases.
